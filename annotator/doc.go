// Package annotator provides an interface for creating annotations with appearance
// streams.  It goes beyond the models package which includes definitions of basic annotation models, in that it
// can create the appearance streams which specify the exact appearance as needed by many pdf viewers for consistent
// appearance of the annotations.
// It also contains methods for generating appearance streams for fields via widget annotations.
